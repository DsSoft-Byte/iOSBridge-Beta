# iOSBridge-Beta
The iOSBridge Beta repo (MainProgramm binaries only)

It WILL get obscure here, feel free to explore the bleeding edge of iOSBridge while i learn how it all works and better myself aswell as the regular iOSBridge versions. Thanks for your trust and support!

The only things distributed here will be the "Debug Executable" (iCu X.exe), as the underlying folder structure/dependencies will still be the same as the latest stable iOSBridge, so if you will have issues try reinstalling with my brand new and shiny installer and then replacing the /MainProgramm/iCu X.exe with the Workflow Artifiact from this repo. Enjoy!
